Region X is noted by the navy blue color, and is also on the right side of the center line. Region Y is visualized by the orange color to the left of the center line. A pattern that I have noticed from this graph, is that close to 90% of the points for both regions was scored in there first quarter, and on multiple occasions, zero points were scored in the second half by one of the regions."
